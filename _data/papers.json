		"abstract": "Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) is a competitive game. There are three actions: rock, paper, and scissors. The game’s
rules are simple: scissors beats paper, rock beats scissors and paper beats rock (all signs stalemate against
themselves). Over multiple games with the same opponent, optimal play according to a Nash Equilibrium requires subjects
to play with genuine randomness. To examine randomness judgments in the context of competition, we tested subjects with
identical sequences in two conditions: one produced from a dice roll, one from someone playing rock, paper, scissors. We
compared these findings to models of subjective randomness from Falk and Konold (1997) and from Griffiths and Tenenbaum
(2001), which explain assessments of randomness as a function of algorithmic complexity and statistical inference,
respectively. In both conditions the models fail to adequately describe subjective randomness judgements of ternary
outcomes. We also observe that context influences perceptions of randomness such that some isomorphic sequences produced
from intentional play are perceived as less random than dice rolls. We discuss this finding in terms of the relation
between patterns and opponent modeling.",

The categorization literature often considers two types of categories as equivalent: (a) standard categories and (b) negation categories.

This study represents the first attempt at delineating these two separate types of generated categories. We specifically test for differences in the distributional structure of generated categories, demonstrating that categories identified as not what was known are larger and wider-spread compared to categories that were identified with a specific label. We also observe consistency in distributional structure across multiple generated categories, replicating and extending previous findings.

facts and knowledge. While it has been suggested that this impairment is caused by a degradation of the semantic store,
the precise ways in which the semantic store is degraded are not well understood. Using a longitudinal corpus of
semantic fluency data (listing of items in a category), we derive semantic network representations of patients with
Alzheimer’s disease and of healthy controls. We contrast our network-based approach with analyzing fluency data with the
standard method of counting the total number of items and perseverations in fluency data. We find that the networks of
Alzheimer’s patients are more connected and that those connections are more randomly distributed than the connections in
networks of healthy individuals. These results suggest that the semantic memory impairment of Alzheimer’s patients can
be modeled through the inclusion of spurious associations between unrelated concepts in the semantic store. We also find
that information from our network analysis of fluency data improves prediction of patient diagnosis compared to
traditional measures of the semantic fluency task.",

The first is evaluative feedback as reinforcement, where rewards and punishments are used to shape learner behavior through reinforcement learning mechanisms. The second is evaluative feedback as communication, where rewards and punishments are used to signal target behavior to a learning agent reasoning about a teacher’s pedagogical goals. We present formalizations of learning from these 2 teaching strategies based on computational frameworks for reinforcement learning. Our analysis based on these models motivates a simple interactive teaching paradigm that distinguishes between the two teaching hypotheses.

This also empowers the person whose behavior is being observed: By intelligently modifying her actions, she can influence the mental representations that an observer ascribes to her, and by extension, what the observer comes to believe about the world. That is, she can engage in intentionally communicative demonstrations. Here, we develop a computational account of generating and interpreting communicative demonstrations by explicitly distinguishing between two interacting types of intentions. Object-directed intentions aim to control states of the physical environment, whereas belief-directed intentions aim to influence an observer’s mental representations. This formulation provides a number of theoretical insights. In particular, our framework (1) extends existing formal models of pragmatics and pedagogy to the setting of value-guided decision-making, (2) captures how people modify their intentional behavior to show what they know about the reward or causal structure of an environment, and (3) helps explain data on infant and child imitation in terms of differential attribution to adult demonstrators’ object-directed and belief-directed intentions. Additionally, our analysis of belief-directed intentionality and mentalizing helps shed light on the socio-cognitive mechanisms that underlie distinctly human forms of communication, culture, and sociality.",

    "abstract": "One popular and classic theory of how the mind encodes knowledge is an associative semantic network, where concepts and associations between concepts correspond to nodes and edges, respectively. A major issue in semantic network research is that there is no consensus among researchers as to the best method for estimating the network of an individual or group. We propose a novel method (U-INVITE) for estimating semantic networks from semantic fluency data (listing items from a category) based on a censored random walk model of memory retrieval. We compare this method to several other methods in the literature for estimating networks from semantic fluency data. In simulations, we find that U-INVITE can recover semantic networks with low error rates given only a moderate amount of data. U-INVITE is the only known method derived from a psychologically plausible process model of memory retrieval and one of two known methods that we found to be consistent estimators of this process: if semantic memory retrieval is consistent with this process, the procedure will eventually estimate the true network (given enough data). We conduct the first exploration of different methods for estimating psychologically-valid semantic networks by comparing people’s similarity judgments of edges estimated by each network estimation method. To encourage best practices, we discuss the merits of each network estimation technique, provide a flow chart that assists with choosing an appropriate method, and supply code for others to employ these techniques on their own data.",

We introduce the Transformed Indian Buffet Process (tIBP), and use it to define a nonparametric Bayesian model that infers features that can transform across instantiations.

However, allowing features to transform adds new kinds of ambiguity: Are two parts of an object the same feature with different transformations or two unique features? What transformations can features undergo? We present two new experiments in which we explore how people resolve these questions, showing that the tIBP model demonstrates a similar sensitivity to context to that shown by human learners when determining the invariant aspects of features",

    "abstract": "Most psychological theories treat the features of objects as being fixed and immediately available to observers. However, novel objects have an infinite array of properties that could potentially be encoded as features, raising the question of how people learn which features to use in representing those objects. We focus on the effects of distributional information on feature learning, considering how a rational agent should use statistical information about the properties of objects in identifying features. Inspired by previous behavioral results on human feature learning, we present an ideal observer model based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics. This model balances the idea that objects have potentially infinitely many features with the goal of using a relatively small number of features to represent any finite set of objects. We then explore the predictions of this ideal observer model. In particular, we investigate whether people are sensitive to how parts co-vary over objects they observe. In a series of four behavioral experiments (three using visual stimuli, one using conceptual stimuli), we demonstrate that people infer different features to represent the same four objects depending on the distribution of parts over the objects they observe. Additionally in all four experiments, the features people infer have consequences for how they generalize properties to novel objects. We also show that simple models that use the raw sensory data as inputs and standard dimensionality reduction techniques (principal component analysis and independent component analysis) are insufficient to explain our results.",

Understanding the effects of context and experience on the representations people use is essential, because if two people encode the same stimulus using different representations, their response to that stimulus may be different. We present a computational framework that can be used to define models that flexibly construct feature representations (where by a feature we mean a part of the image of an object) for a set of observed objects, based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics. Austerweil and Griffiths (2011) presented an initial model constructed in this framework that captures how the distribution of parts affects the features people use to represent a set of objects. We build on this work in three ways. First, although people use features that can be transformed on each observation (e.g., translate on the retinal image), many existing feature learning models can only recognize features that are not transformed (occur identically each time). Consequently, we extend the initial model to infer features that are invariant over a set of transformations, and learn different structures of dependence between feature transformations. Second, we compare two possible methods for capturing the manner that categorization affects feature representations. Finally, we present a model that learns features incrementally, capturing an effect of the order of object presentation on the features people learn. We conclude by considering the implications and limitations of our empirical and theoretical results.",

This hypothesis is controversial in part because it appears to deny the possibility of a universal groundwork for human cognition, and in part because some findings taken to support it have not reliably replicated. We argue that considering this hypothesis through the lens of probabilistic inference has the potential to resolve both issues, at least with respect to certain prominent findings in the domain of color cognition. We explore a probabilistic model that is grounded in a presumed universal perceptual color space and in language-specific categories over that space. The model predicts that categories will most clearly affect color memory when perceptual information is uncertain. In line with earlier studies, we show that this model accounts for language-consistent biases in color reconstruction from memory in English speakers, modulated by uncertainty. We also show, to our knowledge for the first time, that such a model accounts for influential existing data on cross-language differences in color discrimination from memory, both within and across categories.

Spatial cues guide attention to information in the environment that is relevant to the current task. How does the amount of information provided by a location cue and irrelevant information influence the deployment of attention and what are the processes underlying this effect? To address these questions, we used a spatial cueing paradigm to measure the relationship between cue predictability (measured in bits of information) and the voluntary attention effect, the benefit in reaction time (RT) because of cueing a target. We found a linear relationship between cue predictability and the attention effect. To analyze the cognitive processes producing this effect, we used a simple RT model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model. We found that informative cues reduced the amount of evidence necessary to make a response (the threshold), regardless of the presence of irrelevant information (i.e., distractors). However, a change in the rate of evidence accumulation occurred when distractors were present in the display. Thus, the mechanisms underlying the deployment of attention are exquisitely tuned to the amount and behavioral relevancy of statistical information in the environment.",

A recent article by Hills, Jones, and Todd (2012) argued that this pattern reflects a process similar to optimal strategies for foraging for food in patchy spatial environments, with an individual making a strategic decision to switch away from a cluster of related information as it becomes depleted. We demonstrate that similar behavioral phenomena also emerge from a random walk on a semantic network derived from human word-association data. Random walks provide an alternative account of how people search their memories, postulating an undirected rather than a strategic search process. We show that results resembling optimal foraging are produced by random walks when related items are close together in the semantic network. These findings are reminiscent of arguments from the debate on mental imagery, showing how different processes can produce similar results when operating on different representations.",

In this chapter we address an important question that arises within this framework: How do people infer representations that are complex enough to faithfully encode the world but not so complex that they “overfit” noise in the data? We discuss nonparametric Bayesian models as a potential answer to this question. To do so, first we present the mathematical background necessary to understand nonparametric Bayesian models.

    "abstract": "How does the visual system recognize images of a novel object after a single observation despite possible variations in the viewpoint of that object relative to the observer? One possibility is comparing the image with a prototype for invariance over a relevant transformation set (e.g., translations and dilations). However, invariance over rotations (i.e., orientation invariance) has proven difficult to analyze, because it applies to some objects but not others. We propose that the invariant transformations of an object are learned by incorporating prior expectations with real world evidence. We test this proposal by developing an ideal learner model for learning invariance that predicts better learning of orientation dependence when prior expectations about orientation are weak. This prediction was supported in two behavioral experiments, where participants learned the orientation dependence of novel images using feedback from solving arithmetic problems.",

For instance, it is necessary in new environments to learn how to distribute attention – i.e., which stimuli are relevant, and thus should be selected for greater processing, and which are irrelevant, and should be suppressed. Despite this, many experiments implicitly assume that attentional control is a static process (by averaging performance over large blocks of trials). By developing and utilizing new statistical tools, here we demonstrate that the effect of flanking items on response times to a central item (often utilized as an index of attentional control) is systematically and continuously influenced through time by the statistics of the flanking items. We discuss the implications of this finding from the perspective of examining individual differences – where traditional data analysis approaches may confound the rate at which attentional filtering changes through time with the asymptotic ability to filter.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Bayesian account of asymmetries found in speech perception: In many languages, listeners show greater sensitivity if a non-coronal sound (/b/, /p/, /g/, /k/) is changed to coronal sounds (/d/, /t/) than vice versa. The currently predominant explanation for these asymmetries is that they reflect innate constraints from Universal Grammar. Alternatively, we propose that the asymmetries could simply arise from optimal inference given the statistical properties of different speech categories of the listener’s native language. In the framework of Bayesian inference, we examined two statistical parameters of coronal and non-coronal sounds: frequencies of occurrence and variance in articulation. In the languages in which perceptual asymmetries have been found, coronal sounds are either more frequent or more variable than non-coronal sounds. Given such differences, an ideal observer is more likely to perceive a non-coronal speech signal as a coronal segment than vice versa. Thus, the perceptual asymmetries can be explained as a natural consequence of probabilistic inference. The coronal/non-coronal asymmetry is similar to asymmetries observed in many other cognitive domains. Thus, we argue that it is more parsimonious to explain this asymmetry as one of many similar asymmetries found in cognitive processing, rather than a linguistic-specific, innate constraint.",

However, there are few cognitive science approaches to this central phenomenon of norms. While there has been some progress in developing formal representations of norm systems (e.g., deontological approaches), we do not yet know basic properties of human norms: how they are represented, activated, and learned. Further, what computational models can capture these properties, and what algorithms could learn them? In this paper we describe initial experiments on human norm representations in which the context specificity of norms features prominently. We then provide a formal representation of norms using Dempster-Shafer Theory that allows a machine learning algorithm to learn norms under uncertainty from these human data, while preserving their context specificity.",

Recent work has suggested that a censored random walk on a semantic network resembles semantic fluency data because it produces optimal foraging. However, fluency data have rich structure beyond being consistent with optimal foraging. Under the assumption that memory can be represented as a semantic network, we test a variety of memory search processes and examine how well these processes capture the richness of fluency data. The search processes we explore vary in the extent they explore the network globally or exploit local clusters, and whether they are strategic. We found that a censored random walk with a priming component best captures the frequency and clustering effects seen in human fluency data.",

Stark differences arise when demonstrators are intentionally teaching a task versus simply performing a task. In two experiments, we show that human participants systematically modify their teaching behavior consistent with the predictions of our model. Further, we show that even standard IRL algorithms benefit when learning from behaviors that are intentionally pedagogical. We conclude by discussing IRL algorithms that can take advantage of intentional pedagogy.",

    "abstract": "The creative process involves several cognitive processes, such as working memory, controlled attention and task switching. One other process is cognitive search over semantic memory. These search processes can be controlled (e.g., problem solving guided by a heuristic), or uncontrolled (e.g., mind wandering). However, the nature of this search in relation to creativity has rarely been examined from a formal perspective. To do this, we use a random walk model to simulate uncontrolled cognitive search over semantic networks of low and high creative individuals with an equal number of nodes and edges. We show that a random walk over the semantic network of high creative individuals “finds” more unique words and moves further through the network for a given number of steps. Our findings are consistent with the associative theory of creativity, which posits that the structure of semantic memory facilitates search processes to find creative solutions.",

Recent computational models of representation learning have successfully predicted how people discover features (Austerweil & Griffiths, 2013), however, the learned features are assumed to be additive. This assumption is not always true in the real world. Sometimes a basic unit is substitutive (Garner, 1978) - for example, a cat is either furry or hairless, but not both. Here we explore how people form representations for substitutive features, and what computational principles guide such behavior. In an experiment, we show that not only are people capable of forming substitutive feature representations, but they also infer whether a feature should be additive or substitutive depending on the input. This learning behavior is predicted by our novel extension to the Austerweil and Griffiths (2011, 2013)’s feature construction framework, but not their original model.",

Current methods typically fail to find the appropriate level of generalization in a concept hierarchy for a given set of visual examples. Recent work in cognitive science on Bayesian models of generalization addresses this challenge, but prior results assumed that objects were perfectly recognized. We present an algorithm for learning visual concepts directly from images, using probabilistic predictions generated by visual classifiers as the input to a Bayesian generalization model. As no existing challenge data tests this paradigm, we collect and make available a new, large-scale dataset for visual concept learning using the ImageNet hierarchy as the source of possible concepts, with human annotators to provide ground truth labels as to whether a new image is an instance of each concept using a paradigm similar to that used in experiments studying word learning in children. We compare the performance of our system to several baseline algorithms, and show a significant advantage results from combining visual classifiers with the ability to identify an appropriate level of abstraction using Bayesian generalization.",

Understanding the representations and algorithms that underlie human memory search could potentially be useful in other information retrieval settings, including internet search. Psychological studies have revealed clear regularities in how people search their memory, with clusters of semantically related items tending to be retrieved together. These findings have recently been taken as evidence that human memory search is similar to animals foraging for food in patchy environments, with people making a rational decision to switch away from a cluster of related information as it becomes depleted. We demonstrate that the results that were taken as evidence for this account also emerge from a random walk on a semantic network, much like the random web surfer model used in internet search engines. This offers a simpler and more unified account of how people search their memory, postulating a single process rather than one process for exploring a cluster and one process for switching between clusters.",

We propose an ideal observer model based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics for inferring the number of reference frames in a scene and their parameters. When an ambiguous image could be assigned to two conflicting reference frames, the model predicts two factors should influence the reference frame inferred for the image: The image should be more likely to share the reference frame of the closer object (proximity) and it should be more likely to share the reference frame containing the most objects (alignment). We confirm people use both cues using a novel methodology that allows for easy testing of human reference frame inference.",

Shepard (1987) provided a mathematical analysis of generalization in terms of Bayesian inference over the regions of psychological space that might correspond to a given property. He proved that in the unidimensional case, where regions are intervals of the real line, generalization will be a negatively accelerated function of the distance between stimuli, such as an exponential function. These results have been extended to rectangular consequential regions in multiple dimensions, but not for circular consequential regions, which play an important role in explaining generalization for stimuli that are not represented in terms of separable dimensions.

    "abstract": "The Bayesian generalization framework has been successful in explaining how people generalize a property from a few observed stimuli to novel stimuli, across several different domains. To create a successful Bayesian generalization model, modelers typically specify a hypothesis space and prior probability distribution for each specific domain. However, this raises two problems: the models do not scale beyond the (typically small-scale) domain that they were designed for, and the explanatory power of the models is reduced by their reliance on a hand-coded hypothesis space and prior. To solve these two problems, we propose a method for deriving hypothesis spaces and priors from large online databases. We evaluate our method by constructing a hypothesis space and prior for a Bayesian word learning model from WordNet, a large online database that encodes the semantic relationships between words as a network. After validating our approach by replicating a previous word learning study, we apply the same model to a new experiment featuring three additional taxonomic domains (clothing, containers, and seats). In both experiments, we found that the same automatically constructed hypothesis space explains the complex pattern of generalization behavior, producing accurate predictions across a total of six different domains.",

We prove that the confirmation bias is an optimal strategy for testing hypotheses when those hypotheses are deterministic, each making a single prediction about the next event in a sequence. Our proof applies for two normative standards commonly used for evaluating hypothesis testing: maximizing expected information gain and maximizing the probability of falsifying the current hypothesis. This analysis rests on two assumptions: (a) that people predict the next event in a sequence in a way that is consistent with Bayesian inference; and (b) when testing hypotheses, people test the hypothesis to which they assign highest posterior probability. We present four behavioral experiments that support these assumptions, showing that a simple Bayesian model can capture people’s predictions about numerical sequences (Experiments 1 and 2), and that we can alter the hypotheses that people choose to test by manipulating the prior probability of those hypotheses (Experiments 3 and 4).",

Classic analyses suggest that the probability with which people generalize a property from one stimulus to another depends on the distance between those stimuli in psychological space. This raises the question of how people identify an appropriate metric for determining the distance between novel stimuli. In particular, how do people determine if two dimensions should be treated as separable, with distance measured along each dimension independently (as in an $L_1$ metric), or integral, supporting Euclidean distance (as in an $L_2$ metric)? We build on an existing Bayesian model of generalization to show that learning a metric can be formalized as a problem of learning a hypothesis space for generalization, and that both ideal and human learners can learn appropriate hypothesis spaces for a novel domain by learning concepts expressed in that domain.",

We report two psychophysical experiments that disentangled their influence on perception of relative depth in pictures of the interior of a schematic room. Experiment 1 showed that when HPP and DH varied independently with both a ceiling and a floor plane visible in the picture, DH alone determined judgments of relative depth; HPP was irrelevant. Experiment 2 studied relative depth perception in single-plane displays (floor only or ceiling only) in which the horizon either was not visible or was always at the midpoint of the target object. When the target object was viewed against either a floor or a ceiling plane, some observers used DH, but others (erroneously) used HPP. In general, when DH is defined and unambiguous, observers use it to determine the relative distance to objects, but when DH is undefined and/or ambiguous, at least some observers use HPP.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem solved by the human mind is the formation of basic units to represent observed objects that support future decisions. We present an ideal observer model that infers features to represent the raw sensory data of a given set of objects. Based on our rational analysis of feature representation, we predict that the distribution of the parts that compose objects should affect the features people use to infer objects. We confirm this prediction in a behavioral experiment, suggesting that distributional information is one of the factors that determines how people identify the features of objects.",

    "abstract": "Whether scientists test their hypotheses as they ought to has interested both cognitive psychologists and philosophers of science. Classic analyses of hypothesis testing assume that people should pick the test with the largest probability of falsifying their current hypothesis, while experiments have shown that people tend to select tests consistent with that hypothesis. Using two different normative standards, we prove that seeking evidence predicted by your current hypothesis is optimal when the hypotheses in question are deterministic and other reasonable assumptions hold. We test this account with two experiments using a sequential prediction task, in which people guess the next number in a sequence. Experiment 1 shows that people’s predictions can be captured by a simple Bayesian model. Experiment 2 manipulates people’s beliefs about the probabilities of different hypotheses, and shows that they confirm whichever hypothesis they are led to believe is most likely.",

    "abstract": "We present a model for discourse coherence which combines the local entitybased approach of (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) and the HMM-based content model of (Barzilay and Lee, 2004). Unlike the mixture model of (Soricut and Marcu, 2006), we learn local and global features jointly, providing a better theoretical explanation of how they are useful. As the local component of our model we adapt (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) by relaxing independence assumptions so that it is effective when estimated generatively. Our model performs the ordering task competitively with (Soricut and Marcu, 2006), and significantly better than either of the models it is based on.",

    "abstract": "We present a PCFG parsing algorithm that uses a multilevel coarse-to-fine (MLCTF) scheme to improve the efficiency of search for the best parse. Our approach requires the user to specify a sequence of nested partitions or equivalence classes of the PCFG nonterminals. We define a sequence of PCFGs corresponding to each partition, where the nonterminals of each PCFG are clusters of nonterminals of the original source PCFG. We use the results of parsing at a coarser level (i.e., grammar defined in terms of a coarser partition) to prune the next finer level. We present experiments showing that with our algorithm the work load (as measured by the total number of constituents processed) is decreased by a factor of ten with no decrease in parsing accuracy compared to standard CKY parsing with the original PCFG. We suggest that the search space over mlctf algorithms is almost totally unexplored so that future work should be able to improve significantly on these results.",
