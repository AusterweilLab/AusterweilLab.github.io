### MathPsych/ICCM 2018 ###

From July 21-24, the 51st Annual Meeting of the
[Society for Mathematical Psychology](http://www.mathpsych.org/) was jointly
held with the 16th
[International Conference on Cognitive Modeling](https://iccm-conference.github.io/)
in the wonderfully scenic UW -- Madison Memorial Terrace. 

During the first afternoon of talks, Jeff presented his work on a noisy censored
random walk model of memory retrieval that accounts for fluency data with
perseverations. [![alt text]( {{page.assets}}/jeff.jpg

Early on the second day, Xian described his work on modelling category
generation and learning data with contrast based models. [![alt text](

Special shoutout goes to our lab head Joe, who was one of the organizers of this
conference, without whom the conference would not have been the success that it was.

### CogSci 2018 ###

The 40th Annual Meeting of the
[Cognitive Science Society](http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/) was held in
the larger (but no less picturesque) Monona Terrace from July 25-28.

On the final day of talks, Joe presented his work with Nicole on how human
performance in a constrained semantic memory task can be explained with a simple
random walk model. [![alt text](

With an impressive closure of this conference, the final poster session featured
recent work by our undergraduate lab members! 

Kendra succinctly demonstrated evidence against a bilingual advantage in the
domain of creativity. [![alt text](

In a particularly attention-grabbing poster, Jackie illustrated how she modeled
attributes and relations in emojis within a Bayesian generalization
framework.[![alt text]( {{page.assets}}/jackie.jpg)]({{page.assets}}/jackie.jpg)

Thank you to all who attended, presented, and volunteered for these events!
