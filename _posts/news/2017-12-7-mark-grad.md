Congratulations to Mark Ho on successfully defending his graduate work and completing his PhD in Cognitive Science.

To send him off to his next adventure, being a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley with Tom Griffiths and Sanjit Seshia, the Austerweil Lab presented him with a companion to send him off to the west coast.
