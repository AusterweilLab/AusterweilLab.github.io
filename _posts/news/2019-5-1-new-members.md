2019 is shaping to be an exciting year for the Austerweil lab, especially with its massive increase both staff and
student membership.

Joining us since late 2018 we have the honoured presence of our new Research Scientist  Mohsen Afrasiabi, whose technical expertise is likely second
to none. Some say his sense of humour is *definitely* second to none. 

We are super excited to have three enthusiastic graduate students recently coming on board: Pablo Andre Caceres, Ian
Johnston, and Michael Payton. In addition, we are privileged to have Sam Westby joining us as an undergraduate
researcher.

Looking ahead, we would also like to warmly receive Sean Chang who will be re-joining the lab as a full member in the coming weeks!

The Austerweil lab formally welcomes all new members to the lab -- we look forward to an exciting season of research!
