Echo-ing the excitement of our [previous post](http://alab.psych.wisc.edu/news/2019/05/01/new-members.html), 2019 is
again proving to be a fruitful year for the lab due to the sheer number of awards achieved by its members. Though we are
not even halfway through the year, four members have already secured formal recognition of their amazing work:

- Jacqueline Erens and Van Rao, awarded the Hilldale Summer Research Fellowship,
- Sam Westby, achieved the Summer Honors Senior Thesis Award,
- Joe Austerweil, awarded the Distinguished Honors Faculty Award.

Congratulations to all recipients for their incredible acheivements!
