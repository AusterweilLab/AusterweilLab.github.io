In yet another demonstration that undergraduate research is not to be trifled with, lab members Jacqueline Erens and
Kendra Lange presented their impressive work at the University of Wisconsin - Madison's
[20th Annual Undergraduate Symposium](https://ugradsymposium.wisc.edu/) held earlier today.

In a morning session, Kendra discussed her research showing evidence for a null effect of bilingual advantage on creativity.

Later in the afternoon, Jacqueline described how generalization with emojis is driven most strongly by the relations between
the emojis.
