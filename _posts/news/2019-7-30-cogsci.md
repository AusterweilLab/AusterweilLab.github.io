### MathPsych/ICCM 2019 ###

From July 19-22, the 52nd Annual Meeting of the
[Society for Mathematical Psychology](http://www.mathpsych.org/) was jointly
held with the 17th
[International Conference on Cognitive Modeling](https://iccm-conference.github.io/)
in the exciting, bustling city of Montreal.

The lab is incredibly honored to learn that one of this year's William K. Estes Young Investigator Award is none other
than our lab head Joe! Congratulations, Joe!!

During the talks, Xian presented his recent work on how different contrast models of category
generation can be distinguished.

### CogSci 2019 ###

The 41st Annual Meeting of the
[Cognitive Science Society](http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/) followed the Math Psych conference from July 24-27.
The lab had a strong showing of presentations once again, starting with Joe presenting his work -- with our very own Mohsen Afrasiabi
and also Mark Orr (University of Virginia) -- investigating factors influencing team performance by using the Hawkes Process
on a large naturalistic dataset.

We also had Michael enthusiastically describing his brilliant work on subjective randomness in noncooperative games
(e.g., rock paper scissors.)

Xian revealed a new project of his work with Joe on category generation -- this time on how not-old categories can be distinguished
from new categories.

Remember to have a look at our relevant papers over [here](http://alab.psych.wisc.edu/papers/)!

As always, this series of conferences proved to be an engaging and enlightening experience for the lab. Mirroring our
experience with poutine, there was much consumption and digestion of quality cognitive science.
Here's to next year's series of conferences, scheduled to be held in Toronto!
