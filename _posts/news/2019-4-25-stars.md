The Department of Psychology held the 2019 Student Thesis and Research Symposium (STARS) event earlier this evening.
Talented undergraduate students from various laboratories got together to present their latest research in a five-minute
flash talk format followed by a general poster session. 

The Austerweil lab is once again proud to have Jacqueline Erens
discussing her recent study exploring how the informativeness of different synonyms affect word choice.

The entire event was very well attended (evidenced by the lack of seating room), and both talks and posters were well
received by all. Congratulations to all who presented and participated in this event!
