Over the summer, a number of select undergraduates from various universities participated in the Psychology department's
[Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP)](https://psych.wisc.edu/psychological-research-experience-program/). This
year, the lab was privileged to host two students, Rebekah (from Kansas University) and Sophie (Brown University), who
were mentored by Jeff and Nicole respectively. 

A Symposium held on August 2 marked the culmination of these talented undergraduate researchers. Rebekah presented her
work on modelling cognition in github, [![alt text]( {{page.assets}}/rebekah.jpg )]({{page.assets}}/rebekah.jpg) and Sophie
discussed how grocery shopping habits can be a predictor of memory decline. [![alt text]( {{page.assets}}/sophie.jpg

Thank you for joining us this summer, Rebekah and Sophie!
