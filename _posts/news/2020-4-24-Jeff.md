We are thrilled to announce our very own Dr. Jeff Zemla has accepted an Assistant Professorship of Psychology position at Syracuse University! Jeff joined the lab three years ago and has completed work encompassing many areas of psychology, including the complexities of everyday explanations to semantic fluency. His key work in the development of SNAFU will allow researchers to more accurately and efficiently model fluency tasks across different fields of psychology. We wish him the best of luck, and he will be surely missed!

Congratulations Jeff!
