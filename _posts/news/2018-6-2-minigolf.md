To mark the end of another successful semester, the
Austerweil Lab organized a minigolf session at Vitense
Golfland. Despite a good proportion of the group
having never touched a golf club in their lives (author
included), it was a fun-filled night where many balls ended
up where the holes weren't.

This event was made bittersweet with the understanding that
Sean Chang, a treasured member since 2017, would soon be
leaving the lab. The lab wishes him the very best in his
future endeavors. We should be so lucky to have him back again.

By the end of the night, scores were tallied (I think Jeff
won?), tears were shed (for Sean), and fun was had (lots of
it). We look forward to the next party with much excitement.
