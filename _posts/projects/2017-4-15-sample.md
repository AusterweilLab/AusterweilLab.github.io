You can put some more info in here! You can write it in markdown, which is nice. 

I also set up syntax highlighting:

```python
def BagelBites(time):
    if time.lower() in ['morning','evening','suppertime']:
        return('Pizza')
    else:
        raise Exception('When pizza\'s on a bagel, you can have pizza anytime!')
```

Math (inline, \\(y=mx+b\\)) works too!!

e = mc^2
