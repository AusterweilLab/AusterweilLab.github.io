Some introduction, blah blah blah. Here is some code:

```python
def BagelBites(time):
    if time.lower() in ['morning','evening','suppertime']:
        return('Pizza')
    else:
        raise Exception('When pizza\'s on a bagel, you can have pizza anytime!')
```

My special inline math: \\(y=mx+b\\)

My special display math:

$$
e = mc^2
$$

And, hey, look at this table!
