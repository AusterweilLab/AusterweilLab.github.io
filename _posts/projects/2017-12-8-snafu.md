# Overview

The semantic fluency task (listing items within a category) is frequently used
in psychology by both reseachers and clinicians. Analysis of fluency
data is often done by hand, which is time-consuming and error prone. SNAFU
automates the computation of many commonly used metrics, including counting
perseverations, cluster size, switch count, and more.

In recent years, semantic fluency data has been used by many researchers to
infer representations of semantic categories (such as animals). SNAFU
implements many algorithms that use fluency data to construct semantic
networks, a representation of how category members are organized within the
mind. 

SNAFU is intended primarily for research psychologists who wish to analyze
fluency data and compare the semantic networks of different groups or
individuals.

# How do I use it?

SNAFU is available in several flavors. To get the most out of it, you might consider
using SNAFU as a Python library, available here:

[https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py](https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py)

Or install directly using git (auxilliary files are not included):

`pip install git+https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py`


The Github repository contains several demo files, and we currently have a
tutorial under review. For an advanced copy, or for other issues, please
[e-mail us](mailto:zemla@wisc.edu).

A graphical front-end is also available, though it does not contain as many
features as the Python library. You can download it for macOS or Windows. Find
it here:

[SNAFU 2.2.0 for Windows](https://alab.psych.wisc.edu/snafu/snafu-2.2.0-win-x64.zip)

[SNAFU 2.2.1 for macOS](https://alab.psych.wisc.edu/snafu/snafu-2.2.1-mac-x64.zip)
