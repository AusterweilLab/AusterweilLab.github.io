# Overview

The semantic fluency task (listing items within a category) is frequently used
in psychology by both reseachers and clinicians. Analysis of fluency
data is often done by hand, which is time-consuming and error prone. SNAFU
automates the computation of many commonly used metrics, including counting
perseverations, cluster size, switch count, and more.

In recent years, semantic fluency data has been used by many researchers to
infer the mental organization of semantic categories, such as animals. SNAFU
implements many algorithms that use fluency data to construct semantic
networks, a representation of how category members are organized within the
mind. SNAFU will compute several basic network measures (e.g., average node
degree, others) on these representations, and allow researchers to export these
networks for additional analysis.

SNAFU is intended primarily for research psychologists who wish to analyze
fluency data and compare the semantic networks of different groups or
individuals.

# How do I use it?

SNAFU is available in several flavors. To get the most out of it, you might consider
using SNAFU as a Python library, available here:

[https://github.com/AusterweilLab/semnet](https://github.com/AusterweilLab/semnet)


Currently SNAFU has limited documentation, but a good place to start is to
check out one of the demo files such as `make_graphs.py` and [e-mail
us](mailto:zemla@wisc.edu) if you run into trouble.

A graphical front-end is also available, though with even less documentation
(as of now). The GUI has less functionality than the Python library, but
includes many of the most important bits. Find it here:

The *easiest* way to get started is to check our the GUI hosted on our servers,
and click the `?' for a brief walkthrough:
