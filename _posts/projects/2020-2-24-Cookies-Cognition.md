# Overview

For this project, we will be piloting two new behavioral tasks in order to understand whether performance on these tasks are diagnostic of future cognitive impairment and how performance on these tasks change over time. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that imposes a huge burden on individuals, families, and the US healthcare system. Yet early diagnosis of AD remains a difficult challenge. Although biological screening for the disease is possible, it is expensive, not definitive, and rarely conducted outside of research settings.

 Subjective cognitive decline, including memory loss, typically does not occur until years after biological symptoms first appear. Improved early diagnosis of AD will allow individuals to prepare for further cognitive decline, increase enrollment of preclinical patients in research and drug trials, and improve our understanding of the disease’s progression. A simple task that measures decline in everyday functioning could identify at-risk patients who would benefit from regular screening.
