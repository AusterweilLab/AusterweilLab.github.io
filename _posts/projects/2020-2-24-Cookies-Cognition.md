# Overview

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that imposes a huge burden on individuals, families, and the US healthcare system. Yet early diagnosis of AD remains a difficult challenge. Although biological screening for the disease is possible, it is expensive, not definitive, and rarely conducted outside of research settings.

 Subjective cognitive decline, including memory loss, typically does not occur until years after biological symptoms first appear. Improved early diagnosis of AD will allow individuals to prepare for further cognitive decline, increase enrollment of preclinical patients in research and drug trials, and improve our understanding of the disease’s progression. A simple task that measures decline in everyday functioning could identify at-risk patients who would benefit from regular screening. 

 Our lab in seeking participants for our "Cookies and Cognition" project to explore early markers of decline. As part of this project, we invite you to participate in 2 possible studies: 3-month and/or single session. You may participate in one or both studies. 

# Study Information

Study 1: 

For the first study, two new tasks will be piloted in order to understand whether performance on these tasks are diagnostic of future cognitive impairment, and how performance on these tasks change over time. Researchers may also use data from this task to explore additional research questions regarding links between diet and cognitive performance. You may earn up to $105 via Amazon.com gift codes for your participation.

Study 2: 

The second study involves a quick 20-minute online survey examining scientific explanation and risk/reward decision making. You will be compensated $3 via an Amazon.com gift codes for your participation.

Participation in these studies will help improve the understanding of how neurological conditions such as Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s disease develop.

You would be a good fit for this study if you:

•	Are over the age of 55

•	Are 1) cognitively healthy, OR 2) diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment, OR 3) diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease

•	Are the primary grocery shopper for your household (Study 1 only)

•	Have access to a laptop or desktop computer
